sustainable | environment | food</p>\n            <p class=\"entry-subhead\">The planet is in peril, and it’s clear that we cannot restore it without transforming our food system.</p>\n\n        </section>\n\n        <section class=\"article-content\">\n            <p class=\"author\">Written by Tobias Larsen</p>\n            <p>What we eat has changed the planet. Across the globe forests have been devastated to make space to rear cattle and to grow crops to feed livestock, while our oceans become barren as they are trawled and overfished. Food production is not only\n                the greatest driver of wildlife loss, it contributes to climate change: about a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions are associated with food.</p>\n            <h2>1. EAT MORE PLANTS</h2>\n            <p>Farming animals for meat and dairy requires space and huge amounts of water and feed. The livestock industry alone generates nearly 15% of all man made greenhouse gas emissions. With global meat consumption soaring 500% between 1992 and 2016,\n                it is clear we need to rebalance our diets by prioritising plants and moderating our intake of animal products. </p>\n            <img src=\"/f409e074efdaab8e2da38bd4e7dd3ef4.png\" alt=\"Plants\">\n            <h2>2. EAT MORE VARIETY</h2>\n            <p>75% of the world’s food supply comes from just 12 plants and five animal species. Greater diversity in our diets is essential as the lack of variety in agriculture is both bad for nature and a threat to food security. With Knorr we have identified\n                the Future 50 Foods that can help reduce the environmental impact of our food system.</p>\n            <h2>3. USE YOUR VOICE</h2>\n            <p>Right now, the Amazon is burning and the products that we are buying are part of the system that’s driving this devastation. We don’t need to burn or cut down one more tree, there’s more than enough land to grow food to feed 2 billion more\n                people by 2050. Help us press the Government on the issue by ​demanding deforestation free food.</p>\n            <img src=\"/61ec8b63c49d34ab2506d509c102c3ed.png\" alt=\"greens\">\n            <h2>4. MAKE RESPONSIBLE SEAFOOD CHOICES</h2>\n            <p>Roughly 94% of fish stocks are overfished (34%) or maximally sustainably fished (60%) and aquaculture has its own issues. But when responsibly produced, seafood can benefit people, nature and climate. Try a diversity of species from well managed\n                sources, eat lower in the food chain and opt for lower carbon emission seafood. Check out our seafood top tips for more information!</p>\n            <h2>5. CUT THE WASTE</h2>\n            <p>Food waste is a big problem. 30% of the food produced is wasted, with serious repercussions for the environment. In fact, if food waste was a country it would be the 3rd largest emitter of greenhouse gasses after China and the USA. Reducing\n                waste in your household is simple: freeze anything you can’t eat while it’s fresh and, where possible, buy loose produce so you can select the exact amount that you need.</p>\n            <h2>6. GROW YOUR OWN FOOD</h2>\n            <p>What’s better than fresh, home-grown produce straight from the garden? As well as being healthy and delicious, it is free from the carbon footprint of shop-bought food.</p>\n            <img src=\"/9e97a2c4c2d3d4be1fbe45fc60a76832.png\" alt=\"Healthy meal\">\n            <h2>7. LOOK FOR PRODUCTS CONTAINING RSPO CERTIFIED PALM OIL</h2>\n            <p>Unsustainable palm oil is responsible for large-scale deforestation, putting wildlife like orangutans and tigers under threat, as well as contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the risk of climate change. But rejecting palm\n                oil all together could have unintended consequences as alternatives can be even worse for the environment, with some needing up to nine times as much land to produce. When you’re shopping look for products containing RSPO certified sustainable\n                palm oil.</p>\n            <h2>8. PASS ON PLASTIC</h2>\n            <p>Plastic has infiltrated our natural world and even our diets. Bring a reusable-bag when you shop, opt for packaging-free fruit and vegetables where possible, and ask brands and retailers that continue to use plastic to find alternatives.</p>\n            <h2>9. EAT WHAT’S IN SEASON</h2>\n            <p>When possible try to include seasonal produce from your local farm shop or greengrocer in your diet. As well as supporting your local economy, you might get to know local producers and get tips on how to prepare seasonal foods.</p>\n            <img src=\"/53ee9fc9e9951c7288ae3fc6b761d289.png\" alt=\"\">\n        </section>\n        </main>\n        <!-- footer -->\n        <section class=\"footer\" id=\"contact\">\n            <div class=\"footer-mobile\">\n                <p class=\"text-bold\">Contact</p>\n                <p class=\"text-bold\">Connect</p>\n                <div class=\"link-button\"><a href=\"/99bad02247f3eae83c76aa3fe371b715.html\">Sign in</a></div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"footer-desktop\">\n                <div class=\"footer-info\">\n              <div class=\"footer-contact\">\n                  <p class=\"text-bold\">Contact</p>\n                  <p>Guldbergsgade 29N</p>\n                  <p>2200 København</p>\n                  <p>contact@meremad.com</p>\n                  <p>+45 60 60 3478</p>\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"footer-connect\">\n                <p class=\"text-bold\">Connect</p>\n                <p>Instagram</p>\n                <p>Pinterest</p>\n                <p>Youtube</p>\n            </div>\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"footer-signin\">\n                  <div class=\"link-button\"><a href=\"/99bad02247f3eae83c76aa3fe371b715.html\">Sign in</a></div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n    </body>\n\n\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"013c9afe379440bae2c69fb2fdfa3361","cacheData":{}}
